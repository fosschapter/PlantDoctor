    "content": "Powdery mildew is one of the most widespread and easily recognized plant diseases. It appears as a superficial white or gray powdery growth on leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits of various plants. The disease is caused by many specialized races of fungal species in the genera Erysiphe, Microsphaera, Phyllactinia, Podosphaera, Sphaerotheca, and Uncinula. Almost all plants can be affected, including many vegetables, fruits, and ornamentals."

    "content": "Treatment for Powdery Mildew: Remove and destroy all infected plant parts. Improve air circulation by thinning and pruning. Avoid overhead watering to keep foliage dry. Apply sulfur fungicides to prevent infection on susceptible plants. Neem oil, potassium bicarbonate, and milk solutions (1:10 with water) can be effective organic treatments. For severe cases, use appropriate fungicides labeled for powdery mildew."

    "content": "Blight is a general term for a variety of plant diseases that can affect crops and ornamental plants. Early blight and late blight are two common forms affecting tomatoes and potatoes. Late blight, caused by Phytophthora infestans, is especially destructive and was responsible for the Irish potato famine. Symptoms include water-soaked spots on leaves that quickly turn brown, white fuzzy growth on the underside of leaves in humid conditions, and rapid plant collapse."

Apply copper-based fungicides as a preventative measure. For organic gardens, copper treatments and bacillus subtilis products can help. Apply treatments early when conditions favor disease development (humid, wet weather). Clean all garden tools thoroughly when moving between plants."

The spots can vary in size and color depending on the pathogen, plant affected, and stage of development. Common leaf spot fungal diseases include Septoria, Cercospora, and Alternaria leaf spots. Most leaf spot diseases initially cause small, water-soaked lesions that enlarge and change color to tan, brown, or black. Severe infections can cause defoliation."

Ensure proper spacing for adequate air circulation. Apply fungicides labeled for leaf spot diseases when symptoms first appear. Copper-based fungicides and neem oil can be effective for organic gardening. For bacterial leaf spots, copper bactericides may be helpful. Practice crop rotation to prevent disease buildup in the soil."

It manifests as olive-green to brown or black spots on leaves and fruits. Infected leaves may drop prematurely, and severely affected fruits develop cracks that allow secondary infection. The fungus overwinters in fallen leaves and infects new growth in spring during wet periods."

Prune trees to improve air circulation and speed drying of foliage. Apply fungicides starting at bud break until petal fall, especially during wet periods. Organic options include sulfur sprays before bloom and throughout the growing season as needed. Maintain tree vigor through proper nutrition and watering practices."

It appears as black spots with fringed margins on the upper surface of leaves, eventually causing yellowing and premature leaf drop. Repeated defoliation weakens plants, reduces flowering, and makes them more susceptible to other stresses. The disease is favored by humid conditions and temperatures between 65°F and 85°F."

Prune to increase air circulation and avoid wetting the foliage when watering. Apply fungicides preventatively before symptoms appear in spring. Organic options include neem oil, sulfur, and potassium bicarbonate. For chemical control, apply fungicides containing chlorothalonil, myclobutanil, or propiconazole according to label instructions."

Early blight appears as dark brown spots with concentric rings, Septoria leaf spot causes small circular spots with dark borders and gray centers, and bacterial spot creates small, dark, greasy-looking spots. All can significantly reduce yields by defoliating plants."

Use mulch to prevent soil splash onto lower leaves. Remove lower leaves showing symptoms and destroy them. Stake or cage plants to improve air circulation. For fungal leaf spots, apply copper-based fungicides or chlorothalonil at first sign of disease and continue on a 7-10 day schedule in wet weather. For bacterial leaf spots, copper-based bactericides can provide some control."

Each rust fungus is specific to certain host plants. Common examples include cedar-apple rust, rose rust, hollyhock rust, and geranium rust. The pustules release spores that can be spread by wind to infect other plants."
